# Active Context

## Current Focus
- **Gradio Application (Phase 1) Implemented**: The Gradio application (`gradio_app/app.py`) for single audio file processing is now functionally complete. This includes:
  - UI elements for file upload, model selection (separator), CLAP prompt input (manual and preset-based), and parameter adjustments (confidence, chunk duration, audio preservation).
  - Backend logic orchestrating audio separation, resampling, CLAP annotation, result aggregation, JSON output, and temporary file cleanup.
  - CLAP prompt preset loading and saving functionality.
  - Progress updates within the UI.

## Next Steps
- **Comprehensive Testing (Gradio App)**:
  - Test with various audio file types and lengths.
  - Verify functionality of all UI controls (separator models, presets, prompt input, confidence, chunk duration, audio preservation).
  - Test edge cases (e.g., very short audio, audio with no detectable events, invalid inputs).
  - Evaluate error handling and UI feedback.
- **UI/UX Refinement**: Based on testing, identify and implement any necessary improvements to the Gradio application's user interface and experience.
- **Documentation**: Update `README.md` with detailed setup instructions and a comprehensive guide on using the Gradio application for single-file analysis.
- **Phase 2 Planning**: Begin outlining requirements and design considerations for Phase 2, which includes batch processing capabilities.

## Decisions & Considerations
- Phase 1 (single-file processing via Gradio) is considered functionally complete.
- Batch processing remains a Phase 2 goal.
- Default CLAP chunk duration of 3 seconds and confidence threshold of 0.55 remain the standard.
- Audio file preservation is enabled by default in the Gradio UI.
