# Progress

## Phase 1 Completed
- Memory Bank initialization and structure defined.
- Initial high-level plan developed and iteratively refined.
- Detailed plan including CLAP chunking, `ffmpeg` resampling, enhanced UI config, preset system, standardized output, and error handling strategies completed.
- Project directory structure created (incl. `_presets/`, `tests/`, etc.).
- `requirements.txt` created and populated.
- `config/settings.py` implemented with all parameters and model definitions.
- Utility modules implemented and unit tested:
  - `utils/logging_config.py`
  - `utils/file_utils.py`
  - `utils/audio_utils.py`
  - `utils/preset_utils.py`
- Core Modules implemented and unit tested:
  - `audio_separation/separator.py` (`AudioSeparatorWrapper`)
  - `clap_annotation/annotator.py` (`CLAPAnnotatorWrapper`)
- Decision made to implement batch processing/job queue as a Phase 2 feature.

## Recent Improvements
- **Fixed Path Handling**:
  - Modified the annotator to use relative paths in JSON output instead of absolute paths
  - Added proper error handling for paths that can't be made relative
- **Audio File Preservation**:
  - Added functionality to save separated audio files to the output directory
  - Created CLI parameters to control this behavior (`--keep-audio` and `--no-keep-audio`)
  - Added a "preserved_audio_files" field to the JSON output
- **Improved CLAP Analysis Granularity**:
  - Reduced the default chunk duration from 10 seconds to 3 seconds
  - Added a `--chunk-duration` CLI parameter to customize this value
  - Updated the results JSON to include the chunk duration used
- **Fixed CLI Argument Parsing**:
  - Restructured the argument parser to show all options in help output
  - Fixed duplicate default values in help messages
  - Made argument parsing more robust
- **Optimized Parameters**:
  - Updated default confidence threshold from 0.45 to 0.55 based on testing results

## Phase 1 Pending
- **Application (`gradio_app/app.py`)**:
  - Implement UI layout for **single file input** with all controls.
  - Implement core `analyze_audio` workflow function integrating all modules and utilities.
  - Implement preset loading/saving logic tied to UI components.
  - Implement Gradio progress updates.
- **Documentation**:
  - Refine `README.md` (setup, detailed Gradio usage for Phase 1, prerequisites, presets, output structure).
- **Testing**:
  - Implement integration tests for the main single-file workflow through the Gradio UI.

## Current Status
- Core backend logic and utilities for Phase 1 are implemented and unit tested.
- CLI interface is fully functional with optimized parameters.
- Ready for Gradio UI implementation and integration.

## Phase 2 Goals (Post Phase 1)
- **Batch Input**: Allow selecting input folders in Gradio.
- **Job Queue**: Implement backend logic to manage a queue of analysis jobs (one per file).
- **UI Enhancements**: Add UI elements to display the job queue status (pending, running, completed, failed).
- **Job Control**: Implement pause/cancel functionality for jobs in the queue.
- **Concurrency**: Investigate and potentially implement parallel job processing.

## Recent Improvements
- **Gradio Application (`gradio_app/app.py`)**: 
  - Implemented UI layout for **single file input** with all controls (file upload, model selection, presets, prompts, parameters).
  - Implemented core `analyze_audio_wrapper` workflow function integrating all modules and utilities (separation, resampling, annotation, output, cleanup).
  - Implemented preset loading/saving logic tied to UI components.
  - Implemented Gradio progress updates (`gr.Progress`).
  - Integrated audio file preservation option into UI and backend.
  - Resolved numerous `AttributeError` and `TypeError` issues during integration.

## Current Status
- Phase 1 (single-file processing via Gradio and CLI) is functionally complete.
- The Gradio application (`gradio_app/app.py`) provides a UI for the core workflow.
- Ready for comprehensive testing, documentation updates, and potential UI refinement.

## Phase 2 Goals (Post Phase 1)
- **Batch Input**: Allow selecting input folders in Gradio.
- **Job Queue**: Implement backend logic to manage a queue of analysis jobs (one per file).
- **UI Enhancements**: Add UI elements to display the job queue status (pending, running, completed, failed).
- **Job Control**: Implement pause/cancel functionality for jobs in the queue.
- **Concurrency**: Investigate and potentially implement parallel job processing.
